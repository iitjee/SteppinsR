 here's what you can expect to learn. The characteristics of binomial outcome variables, such as buys versus doesn't buy, 
 and recovers or get worse, any kind of situation which you might have to make a decision between two or more alternatives
 is an appropriate kind of context for this course. You'll also learn about the reasons that binomial outcome variables create
 problems for standard analysis procedures such as simple and multiple regression.

You'll see how simple transformations that involve odds ratios and logarithms can solve the problems that binomial outcomes
bring to regression analysis. Now I use Excel in this course mainly to show you what goes on inside logistic regression's 
black box. You'll be able to see the intermediate calculations involving those odds and those logarithms, and I use R to show 
you how to reach the end point of the analysis quickly so that you can skip over those intermediate kinds of calculations.
